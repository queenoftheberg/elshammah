        <h2>FISHING PROJECT</h2>
        <h3>Coming soon . . . </h3>
        <h3>ETA: September / October 2023</h3>
        <h4></h4>
        <p>We have a dream of a fleet of fishing boats covering large sections of the coast, catching different types of fish in the various seasons. </p>
        <p>Both humans and animals need to eat protein. Currently, fish is made into fish meal, which is fed to animals. <br/>We can use a totally different process to make the fish suitable for human consumption. </p>
        <p>Watch this space for more information soon! </p>
        <!--p>Establish a fleet of fishing boats covering the coast from north to south, catching all different types of fish, throughout the season. To put freezers in all the boats to be able to stay out till the boats are full. Taking over much of the fishing industry, feeding the nation, providing more and more local jobs, as the project grows. </p-->
